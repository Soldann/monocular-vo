# Dataset setup

Create a folder called `datasets`, download and unzip the datasets found here into that folder:

Description | Link (size)
------------- | ----------
Parking garage dataset (easy) |	[parking.zip](https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/docs/teaching/2024/parking.zip) (208.3 MB)
KITTI 05 dataset (hard)	| [kitti05.zip](https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/docs/teaching/2024/kitti05.zip) (1.4 GB)
Malaga 07 dataset (hard) | [malaga-urban-dataset-extract-07.zip](https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/docs/teaching/2024/malaga-urban-dataset-extract-07.zip) (2.4 GB)

This should get you folders `datasets/kitti`, `datasets/malaga-urban-dataset-extract-07`, and `datasets/parking`
for use in the pipeline.
